## Three questions about partisan prejudice: {#sec-three-questions-about-partisan-prejudice}

1.  What causes partisan prejudice?
2.  Does partisan prejudice matter?
3.  What do we mean by partisan prejudice?

::: notes
-   Research in this area has clearly exploded in the past 10-15 years. Lots of research focuses on what causes partisan animosity. is it the media, political beliefs, identity, political elites, and so on.

-   more recent research has also focused on whether or not this stuff matters for political behavior or intergroup behavior.

-however, and i think this is common in the social sciences, there has been far less about what do people mean when they express partisan animosity. there are a few papers out there, for instance by krupnikov, levendusky, druckman, and others about who people have in mind when they answer feeling thermometer questions. but in my mind there is still quite a bit of conceptual muddiness about what we exactly we are measuring.
:::

## Partisan prejudice is whatever it is that we measure {#sec-partisan-prejudice-is-whatever-it-is-that-we-measure}

1.  Feeling thermometers (and other measures) on surveys
2.  Bias in vignettes and behavioral games
3.  Outrage on social media

::: fragment
But what are we measuring?
:::

::: notes
The most straightforward answer to this question is that partisan animosity is defined by the measures we use to capture it. This could include feeling thermometer scores, increased willingness to discriminate in economic games, or heightened expressions of outrage on social media. While this approach is valid, it feels somewhat unsatisfying—a bit like defining happiness solely by what a happiness scale measures.

## Prejudice as cheap talk {#sec-prejudice-as-cheap-talk}

Answering a question on a survey is basically costless—it is cheap talk. Why not just respond in a way that expresses some inner consideration, rather than a true belief? “Yea for my team, boo for yours." (Fiorina, 2024)

::: notes
The literature suggests two main explanations for why people express animosity toward the opposing party: 1. Cheap Talk: As Fiorina argues, expressions of animosity may be exaggerated and not reflective of deeply held beliefs or actions. They are, in essence, performative.

## Prejudice as cheap talk

1.  People are willing to lose money to avoid working with someone from the other side (McConnell et al, 2018)
2.  Saying crazy stuff publicly is not cheap talk
3.  Partisan bias in behavioral games is correlated with feeling thermomer scores

::: notes
I am skeptical of the cheap talk argument for a few reasons. I think the definitive paper on this is by McConnell et al in AJPS. they conduct a variety of field experiments and find that people are willing to lose money to avoid working with someone from the other side or to benefit the outparty. This suggests that people are not just saying things on surveys, but that they are willing to act on their beliefs. Second, there is clearly a lot of vitriol on social media and that is not costless. I have one distant relative who was uninvited from his family's thanksgiving dinner because of his rant on facebook after the election. That is not cheap talk. Finally, there is a correlation between partisan bias in behavioral games and feeling thermometer scores. This is data from one recent study which included a dictator game wherein people were given an endowment and were told that they could split it anyway they wanted with the outparty player. There is a fairly strong correlation here, where in the more people liked the outparty the more money they were willing to give them. This suggests that people are not just saying things on surveys, but that they are willing to act on their beliefs.

## Prejudice as outparty loathing {.smaller}

-   What is corroding American politics is, specifically, negative partisanship: Although most liberals feel conflicted about the Democratic Party, they really hate the Republican Party. And even though most conservatives feel conflicted about the Republican Party, they really hate the Democratic Party. America's political divisions are driven by hatred of an out-group rather than love of the in-group. (Mounk, 2019)

-   Out-party hate has emerged as a stronger force than in-party love (Finkel et al, 2020)

-   Parties hang together mainly out of sheer hatred of the other team, rather than a shared sense of purpose (Abramowitz and Webster, 2017)

::: notes
The second explanation for partisan prejudice is that it is primarily driven by outparty hatred. As Finkel et al. argue, outparty hate has become a more powerful force than inparty love. Similarly, Abramowitz and Webster observe that parties remain cohesive not due to a shared sense of purpose, but largely because of mutual disdain for the opposing side.

This perspective dominates the literature to such an extent that many recent studies neglect to measure inparty feelings altogether. For example, in their AJPS article claiming that affective polarization has limited consequences, Broockman et al. manipulate outparty feelings experimentally but do not examine changes in inparty feelings.

Researchers have come to this conclusion in a number of ways.

::: notes
perhaps the dominant way is to regress some outcome, be it political participation, support for anti-democratic policies, partisan strength on feelings towards the inparty and feelings towards the outparty. and these studies generally conclude with some statement like this one where …ratings of the opposing party had a significant effect on party loyalty … rating of one’s own party had no discernible effect on vote choice in this analysis.

## Behavioral games show more outgroup bias than ingroup favoritism {#sec-behavioral-games-show-more-outgroup-bias-than-ingroup-favoritism}

![](images/is_game.png)

-Iyengar and Westwood (2015)

::: notes
Another way that researchers have come to this conclusion is through behavioral games. In a study by Iyengar and Westwood, participants are randomly assigned to play a trust game with another player who is either an outparty member, an inparty member, a control or an independent. compared to when people play an independent or a situation where pid is not shown, people tend to discriminate more against the outpartisan member than they favor the inparty member, leading them to conclude that outparty dislike dominates inparty affect
:::

## Outparty feelings have dropped, inparty feelings have not {#sec-outparty-feelings-have-dropped-inparty-feelings-have-not}

![](figures/affpol.png)

::: notes
perhaps the most often cited piece of evidence demonstrating that outparty hate dominates is that if you look at feeling thermometer ratings over time, inparty feelings have remained stable while out party feelings have dropped.

::: notes
and finally there is a good amount of recent research that now equates animosity with public expressions of negative affect. these types of statements are both increasing and more likely to go viral than are public expressions of positive affect. ok, so that's the evidence, as i see it, for why outparty hates dominates.

## Revisiting claims of outgroup hate

1.  Horse race comparisons of coefficients with cross-sectional data can't tell us about which coefficient is more important.
2.  Behavioral measures of hate are not greater than behavioral measures of love
3.  People may be expressing outrage not because they feel it, because they believe it is normative or that it will help them gain status or approval from others

::: notes
there are a few reasons why i don't think this evidence is dispositive however. first is that i am not sure we learn much about which variable is more important. causally from cross-sectional regressions. second, typical trust games can't differentiate between ingroup love and outgroup hate. and finally, people may be expressing outrage on surveys publicly or even on surveys, but it may be less reflective of animosity than responding to perceived norms

## The psychological primacy of the ingroup

-   Athough we could not perceive our own ingroups excepting as they contrast to outgroups, still the ingroups are psychologically primary. We live in them, by them, and sometimes, for them. Hostility toward outgroups helps strengthen our sense of belonging, but it is not required (Allport, 1954, pp. 40-41).

::: notes
```         
the psych literature has generally argued that ingroup attitudes are psychologically dominant. meaning, i may hate the out group, but that is only because of my affection for the ingroup. for instance allport describes ingroups as psychologically primary. he writes. now, i'm not sure that he had evidence to back this claim back then, but to the extent that he is correct and that party identity is in fact a social identity, it would imply that it is unlike other social identities if, as the literature claims, loathing is dominant.

-   Coefficients in cross-sectional regressions don't teach us much total effects of one variable or another
-   Variable importance metrics show no real differences between outgroup and ingroup feelings in predicting outcomes
:::
:::::

::: notes
if allport and tajfel and brewer and others are right, the relationship between affect and outcomes looks something like this, where inparty feelings lead to outparty feelings and then some outcome. if this is the case, then these regression models are essentially controlling for a mediator and we see the controlld direct effect not the total effect. i'm not really sure how we can parse this out with this data or if we can design an experiment where we move outparty attitudes but not inparty attitudes. another way we can assess this is to see if out of sample predictions get worse if we remove one of these measures from the model. this doesn't give us any causal interpretation of these variables but it helps us get at their importance in prediction. if you do this, you see generally that both are equally important in predicting outcomes.

## How do we differentiate between ingroup love and outgroup hate? {#sec-how-do-we-differentiate-between-ingroup-love-and-outgroup-hate}

1.  Beavioral experiments in the literature are zero-sum

2.  Intergroup prisoner's dilemma maximizing difference game (Halevy, Bornstein, Sagiv 2008; Halevy, Weisel, Bornstein 2012)

3.  Lee et al, 2022, N=500 from Bovitz Forthright Panel

::: notes
the third piece of evidence concerns behavioral games. most of these games are zero sum, meaning that it's impossible to know if people are motivated by ingroup love or outgroup hate. iyengar and westwood attempt to get at this by including an independent or non-partisan control group but it's not clear to me that an independent or non-partisan is actually a pure control. people may still consider independents outgroups and people. to get past this Halevy and colleagues created what they called the intergroup prisoner's dilemma maximizing difference game. A few years ago, Amber Lee, Alex Theordiris, Carly Beth Hawkins and I ran this game among

Game is played between two groups of three players each

Each player receives an endowment of 10 tokens and individually decides how many tokens to keep for themselves or contribute to two different funds (a group fund which only affects the payoffs of the contributor and their own group members or a competitive fund which includes both the contributor's own and opposing group members)

500 people from the bovitz forthright sample, people actually played alone but were told they were playing with others

## Summary: Intergroup prisoner's dilemma maximizing difference game

1.  Outgroup hostility does not swamp ingroup love
2.  However, unlike other social identities, ingroup and outgroup feelings were comparable.
3.  Ingroup affect (not outgroup affect) was correlated with outgroup discrimination (See [Appendix](#sec-ipd-fts))

## Why did outparty feelings drop?

::::: columns

-   Genuine drop in feelings or
-   It is that it is now acceptable (even encouraged) to say that you dislike the other side, but not other groups

:::::

::: notes
the third piece of evidence is that outparty feelings have dropped while inparty feels have stayed stable. In our first paper on affective polarization we noted this as well as noted that feelings towards other groups have increased. while i initially took this at face value, i've more recently considered the possibility that it is now acceptable or even encouraged to say you hate the other party but inappropriate to say you dislike other groups.
:::

## Hating the other party is potentially socially desirable

1.  People report that they would report hating the other side if the goal was to impress members of the inparty (Connors, 2023)
2.  But priming privacy had no effect.
3.  No evidence of partisan bias in telephone interviews in the 2006 ANES pilot (Healy and Malhotra, 2014)

::: notes
Elizabeth Connors has made this claim in a recent paper in poq. she finds that if you ask people what they would say to impress members of their party they would say they hate the inparty and finds that those who are high on self-monitoring are more likely to say they hate the other party. however, she she ran an experiment where she primed privacy or not and did not find any effect. however, my argument is not animosity is a social signal, and as such, depends on the perceived audience. there has been one study that looks at the role of interviewer party identity on political beliefs, and finds null results, but this was a telephone interview and identity cues were probavbly not particularly strong there.
:::

## Are expressions of prejudice contextually determined?

1.  However, 2012 ANES face-to-face interview asked for interviewer pids.
2.  We can estimate the difference in the survey responses for respondents interviewed by inparty interviewers compared to those interviewed by outparty interviewers

## Data and Methods

1.  Respondent N =\~1500 , Interviewer N=114
2.  DVs: R's asked their feelings towards the parties and the presidential candidates (0-100) and how much they dislike or like each of the parties (0-10)
3.  Matched PID dummy: if the interviewer and respondent shared a party identity 1, otherwise 0
4.  Matched Race dummy and Matched Gender dummy
5.  Regressed DVs on Matched PID and Interviewer Fixed Effects, SEs Clustered by IWR

## The Information Exchange Study

1.  With Shengchun Huang

2.  1501 participants were recruited from MTurk (CloudResearch approved participants) and randomly paired with another participant.

3.  Half of respondents were randomly assigned to also see demographic information, including the PID of their partner.

## The Information Exchange Study

1.  Each participant saw 6 randomly news stories and asked to share one with their partner, who went through the same process.

2.  They rated the stories, and then repeated the process two more times.

3.  Afterwards were asked to rate how trustworthy their partner was, to guess their partner's identity, and ask if they wanted to share part of their bonus with them.

-   Then randomized question order:

    -   Report if they would engage in some sort of "cancelling" behavior

    -   Report whether or not people in their party would approve of each of the cancelling behaviors

## Animosity and approval

1.  In the information exchange experiment:
    1.  people were more likely to correctly identify the partisanship of those who shared more negative info
    2.  people were more likely to allocate part of their bonus to those who shared more negative info about the other side and say they trusted them more
2.  In the piling on study:
    1.  people were more likely to identify, express affection, and say that other in party members would approve of those those who piled on

# Recap

1.  Partisan prejudice is probably not just cheap talk
2.  It's not clear that out-party hate has emerged as a stronger force than in-party love
3.  Expressions of animosity are contextually determined and based on perceived social norms

## Implications (1)

1.  Inparty feelings may be more important than outparty feelings in predicting downstream behavior.
    1.  Panel data showing that within person changes in inparty feelings are more predictive of support for anti-democratic actions than are changes in outparty feelings
    2.  Inparty misperception corrections are more effective than outparty misperception corrections in reducing affective polarization (Appendix in Dias et al, 2024)

## Implications (2)

1.  Animosity still matters in shaping what people think think people in their group believe and in shaping the tenor of public sphere

<!-- -->

2.  However, there is widespread pluralistic ignorance on the acceptability of animosity–interventions could aim at altering perceptions of ingroup norms
